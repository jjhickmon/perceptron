# perceptron
Testing my understanding of Machine Learning fundamentals such as gradient descent and back propagation 
by creating a single-layer perceptron from scratch.


In this demo, the red line is the model's estimate of the gradient between the white and the black dots. 
The green dots are the ones that the model correctly estimated, and the red dots are incorrect.
